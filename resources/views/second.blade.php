</h1></center>
<center><p>Parks play a huge role in society and encourage everyone to take better care of their surroundings. One can become free and have a good time visiting a nearby park. Here is a short essay for classes 1, 2, and 3 on parks:

    A day at the park is like spending a day filled with fun and games. Thereâ€™s nothing but tons of entertainment and recreation! Some parks host creative workshops, as I saw several artists sketching in public last summer. My mom took me to the park yesterday, and I saw an old man painting pictures. I felt so inspired. I made a few new friends, and we used the see-saws together. No vehicles are allowed in the park; the best part is that it is always so clean. The cotton candy seller is nice and gives me great discounts whenever I visit. I regularly visit the park nearby and bring plenty of snacks from home to share with my friends. Sometimes, I go for an after-meal walk with my parents. It is so satisfying and calming. Playing in the park is so much fun!
